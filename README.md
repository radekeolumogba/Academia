Some samples of my submissions at university

Please view:
A. PingPong_game.cpp - its corresponding main is PingPong_main.cpp
B. main.cpp - its of a blackjack card game to go along with the header files Blackjack.h, Card.h and Hand.h

Notes:
PingPong was a ARM mbed LPC1768 implementation of the Ping Pong game through lighting LEDs upon a push of buttons. The lights would 'move' in directions. It was entirely my own design for a final course project except that the concept of implementing a 'game' was professor given. Hardware-software integration excites me, but what was most satisfying was the project's all-inclusive nature. The deliberations from concept to production of the processes, procedures, softwares and hardwares to use; be it Vivado for FPGA implementation or high-level for VHDL through MATLAB/Vivado sythesis or simply C++ and direct microcontroller control. Most importantly, I enjoyed the model selection aspect of understanding the game scenario and therefore concluding to apply a state machine rather than a sequential program, communicating process, dataflow, or object-oriented model. I was given the option of FPGA or microcontroller implementation but I decided speed and efficiency needs weren't so important and the number of computations and size of machine wasn't much to need as low-level of control to warrant FPGA design.

main.cpp was a Bachelors uni assignment led by the professor, also for a microcontroller, implementing a Blackjack game. The comments (steps) were provided guidance written by the proffessor. The implementation, not the planning, was mine. The header files were a collaboration of his instructive comments and my design. Although it didn't have significant application, I valued the intricacies of memory considerations upon routine techniques.
